## Welcome to the computational mathematics VRG!

This week we discussed the general lifecycle and creation process of
programs and other artifacts of human culture. Over the next couple of
weeks, I expect students to work on framing one or more problems, and try
and come up with both large and small scale goals and methods of evaluating
their progress.
