<h3> Topics </h3>

This semester's computational VRG has focused on a number of topics, according to the needs of the registered students. These have included:
<ul>
    <li> instruction in idiomatic coding in Python, Haskell, SAGE and MATLAB </li>
    <li> developing familiarity with programming abstractions and object oriented approaches </li>
    <li> application of software design patterns of object oriented, functional and procedural contexts </li>
    <li> student project for application to low dimensional topology, mathematical biology and numerical analysis </li>
</ul>

<h3> Approach </h3>
In this course, I have tried to take a wholistic approach to computation, with the idea that skills which the students learn can be applicable to other projects outside of computer programming, such as their mathematical research.

To get a feel for this approach, you can take a look at the introductory course slides in PDF format: <a href="{{ "/creating_artifacts.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl}}">Creation of Cultural Artifacts</a>
